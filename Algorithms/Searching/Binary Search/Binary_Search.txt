			       ------   ------



Binary search is a Algorithm which is used for searching a item  in  sorted 
array (*note only on sorted array)

in this binary searching we have three key terms they are 

1 mid 
2 left
3 right

mid = left+(right-l)/2

initially 

left=0
right=array length -1(which is last element index in array)

every time we  look at mid value if it is the value we are searching for we simply return 
but it greater than the mid value we will we will ignore the left by simply 
increasing the left value to mid+1
left = mid+1

if target value is less than the mid value we decrease the right value to 
mid-1


we are going to use while loop for it the while to runs until left lessthan or equal to right 

           algorithm
           ---------

STEP 1 :- Finding mid value 

formula = mid = left+(right-l)/2

STEP 2 :- Check If target = array[mid] 
                 if yes then we found it 
STEP 3 :- Check if target > array[mid] 
                   if yes left=mid+1
Step 4 :- else r=mid-1 
               because target less than array[mid] value

we will do these setps in while loop as long as the left is less than or equal to right

main(){
l=0
r=arr of len -1
while(l<=r)
{
STEP 1
STEP 2
STEP 3
STEP 4
}
we did not found it 
}
